# TaskCounter
A simple web application for adding, removing, and counting daily tasks. Users can manage their to-do list, mark completed tasks, and always see the current number of active tasks.

Daily Tasks App

This is a simple and user-friendly web app created by the team for GitHub practice and team development. It allows you to add, view, and delete daily tasks, as well as see the current number of active tasks.

Key Concept

In the center of the screen is a list of all current tasks. Below is an input field where the user types the text for a new task. Below the input field is a task counter, which shows how many tasks are currently in the list. Below that are two buttons: plus and minus.

Key Functionality

Adding a Task

Enter the task text in the input field.

Click the plus button.

The task will appear in the top list, and the counter will increase by 1.

Deleting Text from a Field

If you accidentally entered something incorrectly, click the minus sign.

The input field will be cleared, and the task will not be added.

Deleting a Task from the List

Next to each task, there is a small checkbox.

Check the task you want to delete.

It will appear in the input field.

Click the "minus" sign — the task will disappear from the list, and the counter will decrease.

Automatic counter update

The counter increases when a task is added and decreases when a task is deleted.

It always displays the current number of tasks in the list.

Interface structure

The top section (2/3 of the screen) is the task list block.

The middle section is the task text input field.

Below is a block with a number indicating the number of tasks.

The bottom section contains two buttons: "+" (add) and "-" (delete).

Technical implementation

The project is implemented using pure HTML / CSS / JavaScript.

All data is stored in the browser's memory (no server).

The counter and list logic is written in JavaScript.

The layout is adapted to basic screen sizes.

Team tasks

Each team member is responsible for their own part of the project — from the markup and styles to the logic for adding, deleting, and the counter. All changes are made through separate branches and pull requests in GitHub, followed by code review by the team lead.
